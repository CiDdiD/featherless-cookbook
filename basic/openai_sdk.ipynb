    "# Featherless OpenAI Compatibility\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to make an API call with Featherless by adjusting the OpenAI SDK parameters.\n",
    "This compatibility extends across the ecosystem of applications and tools built for OpenAI, making the transition to Featherless straightforward for teams working with these tools. You can find a list of a few of those applications [here](https://featherless.ai/blog/running-open-source-llms-in-popular-ai-clients-with-featherless-a-complete-guide).\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Sign up for an account at [Featherless](https://featherless.ai/register)\n",
    "2. Subscribe to a plan and get your API key from [API Keys page](https://featherless.ai/account/api-keys)\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First, let's import the required libraries and set up our API key."
